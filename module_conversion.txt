.Notes
- All objects:
  * Add `x_twitter` to `resources` block, pointing to Twitter HTTP URL
  * Add `x_IRC` to `resources` block
  * Add `=for html` block with `<a href="chat.mibbit.com">` link; see
    https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo#SUPPORT[Moo.pm#SUPPORT (MetaCPAN)] for an
    example
- `Cairo::GObject`
  * Changes for _Updated README_ and _CPAN META_ are committed to personal
    GitHub (https://github.com/cpanxaoc/perl-Cairo-GObject.git)
- `Champlain`
  * `README` needs address updated
- `Clutter`
  * `Clutter` uses `Dist::Zilla`, so FSF address and CPAN Meta are controlled
    by `Dist::Zilla` modules/plugins
  * `CPAN::Meta::Spec` config blocks need to be added to `dzil.ini`
  * No long license blurbs were found in `Clutter`
- `ExtUtils::Depends`
  * The `README` in `ExtUtils::Depends` was updated with mailing list, bug
    tracker, and Git URLs, although the format of the update doesn't match the
    format in `Cairo`
  * The FSF's address is never used in any of the files in
    `ExtUtils::Depends`, so updating the address and shortening the blurb
    doesn't make sense
- `ExtUtils::PkgConfig`
  * The FSF's address is only used in `lib/ExtUtils/PkgConfig.pm`
- `Glib`
  * All of the license blurbs are full length
- `Glib::IO`
  * `Glib::IO` uses `Dist::Zilla`, so FSF address and CPAN Meta are controlled
    by `Dist::Zilla` modules/plugins
  * `CPAN::Meta::Spec` config blocks need to be added to `dzil.ini`
  * No long license blurbs were found in `Glib::IO`
- `Gnome2::Print` is marked as deprecated in favor of Gtk2 1.140 or newer
  * Should the FSF addresses and other changes be applied to deprecated
    projects?
- `Gtk2::Champlain`
  * `README` has the old address, `COPYING` has the new address
- `Gtk2`
  * `README` has a link to the Bugzilla bug tracker
- `Gtk2::GladeXML`
  * `README` has a link to the Bugzilla bug tracker
- `Gtk2::MozEmbed`
  * Has a `META_MERGE` block, but with just a few entries
- `Gtk2::SourceView2`
  * Has a `META_MERGE` block with the git repo
  * `COPYING` has the new address, all other files have the old address
- `Gtk2::Unique`
  * There are no FSF license blurbs in `Gtk2::Unique`
  * There's one license blurb in `lib/Gtk2/Unique.pm`, setting the license to
    Artistic/GPL1
- `Gtk3`
  * `README` has link to Bugzilla
  * There's no full license block anywhere in the code, so no shortening needs
    to be done
  * The `LICENSE` file is provided by `Dist::Zilla`, and has the current FSF
    address
- `Pango`
  * `README` has link to Bugzilla
