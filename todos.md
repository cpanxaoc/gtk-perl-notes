  - Updating the version numbers in the correct files
  - Copying out POD docs to a common POD docs directory for uploading to the

      the POD files at the correct time?

  - Unpacking and building the tarball
  - Generating the release announcement e-mail
    - Add MD5/SHA1 checksums for downloaded files
  - Generating the release announcement blurbs for Sourceforge and Freshmeat
    - Posting said blurbs on Sourceforge and Freshmeat
    - Checking that the blurbs posted correctly on Sourceforge and Freshmeat
  - Uploading the release tarball
    - CPAN
    - Sourceforge
  - Generating the e-mail for the next release due date
  - Getting `bit.ly` URLs for twits
- Release Helper
  - Check—ï for correct versions of ExtUtils::MakeMaker and CPAN::Meta
  - Generates release e-mail
